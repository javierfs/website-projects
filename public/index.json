Nowadays, listen to any kind of music has become very easy. Nearly any album you can think of, it is available only one click away. The behavior of the music users has also changed and todayâ€™s listeners do not want to play song by song, album by album and artist by artist to find their next musical obsession. Many listeners would like to discover music thatâ€™s been selected exclusively for their taste and in a format thatâ€™s easily accessible. That is achieved by the use of playlists. Their importance has never been greater for both music distributors and audiences they are trying to reach. Playlists are a fundamental tool to discover, consume or market music. Being included in the right playlists can boost the streaming numbers and maximize the exposure to a truly global audience. The large number of users and content of the music streaming platforms provides a vast amount of information that holds interesting patterns that could impact in business decision-making.

There is 399 Spotify playlists while the rest were created by independent users. As mentioned, the playlists has two types of owners: Spotify (the own music platform) and independent users. According to the distribution of the data, the vast majority of the playlists are concentrated in a range below 250.000 monthly streams. From this chart, you can see that playlists from Spotify reaches higher number of streams and particularly there is two Superstar playlists that has \u003e40M streams! Looking at its characteristics, we can figure out that those playlists are two of the current 50 and 100 top hits songs. Probably these are heavily curated and I will consider them as outliers in the future stages of this analysis. As a first hint on where are the playlists concentrated when it comes to monthly streams, I want to investigate a bit further and show the proportion of playlists across different monthly stream ranges to identify those playlists with very few engagement. Furthermore, I will analyze the monthly active users of the playlists. Fig 2. Barcharts showing the percentage of playlists over monthly streams (30s) from listeners ranges (top) and monthly active users (MAU) ranges (middle). The bottom barchart shows the number of MAU of the top 15 most streamed playlists. As shown above, there is more than 30% of the playlists in the dataset with less than 10 monthly streams. Besides, there is more than 60% of the playlisyt with less than 3 monthly active users. If we compare these numbers, we observe that the top most streamed playlists have 100,000x the size of more than 60% of the playlists. These are massive ranges, and as we are interested in the most successful playlists, I will discard playlists with: Less than 3 monthly active users.

In the following section I will discuss the linear relationship between the number of tracks, artists, albums and tokens with the number of monthly streams from the listeners. As these numbers are huge, both axis will be displayed in logarithmic scale. I will start analyzing the relationship of the number of tracks and the streams: Fig 3. Scatterplot along with the curve resulted of fitting a linear regression between the monthly streams (30s) from listeners and the number of tracks. Each green data point corresponds to a single playlist. The data is shown in a log-scaled due to the skewness of the distribution towards very high values. The results of the statistical tests are shown on the top of the plot. Statistical Concepts Hypothesis testing: Determine whether there is enough statistical evidence in favor of a certain belief, or hypothesis, about a parameter. It is common to test two hypothesis: Null Hypothesis ($H_0$): Assumes that any kind of difference between the chosen characteristics that you see in a set of data is due to chance. Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$): A statement that contradicts the null hypothesis. Statistical significance: Probability that the observed difference between two groups is due to chance. This is quantified by using the $ p $-value. If this value is larger than the significance $ \\alpha $ level chosen (eg, $ .05 $, assuming $ 95\\% $ of confidence level $ CI_{95\\%} $ ), any observed difference is assumed to be explained by sampling variability and therefore not considered significant Effect size: Magnitude of the difference between groups. Classical Inferential Statistics Hypothesis testing uses statistical tests to determine whether a predictor variable has a statistically significant relationship with an outcome variable or to estimate the difference between two or more groups. Depending on how many groups one wants to compare there exists different statistical test: Compare two variables or groups: $ t $-tests: This statistical test estimates the true difference between two group means using the ratio of the difference in group means over the pooled standard error of both groups. A larger $ t $-value shows that the difference between group means is greater than the pooled standard error, indicating a more significant difference between the groups. After the $ t $-value is found, one can calculate the $ p $-value compared to the critical value. As mentioned before, is often consider a $ p $-value $ \u003c 0.05 $ enough to reject the null hypothesis and therefore determining there is a statistical difference between groups. Comparing more than two groups: Analysis of the Variance (ANOVA): ANOVA uses the $ Fisher $ or $ F $-test for statistical significance: it compares the variance in each group mean from the overall group variance. If the variance within groups is smaller than the variance between groups, the $ F $-test will find a higher $ F $-value, and therefore a higher likelihood that the difference observed is real and not due to chance. This allows for comparison of multiple means at once, because the error is calculated for the whole set of comparisons rather than for each individual two-way comparison (which would happen with a $ t $-test). Robust Inferential Statistics Classic inferential methods like the ANOVA $ F $-test or the $ t $-test assume normality and homoscedasticity (equal variances). If the data does not follow this, the tests can yield to inaccurate confidence intervals and poorly characterization of the extent of groups difference. Also, the presence of heavy outliers can alter the characteristics of the variables analyzed. Robust statistical methods deals with all these concerns. Robust Location Measures: Trimmed means: this robust alternative to the arithmetic mean contains the sample median as a special case.

Another one is whether the positivity or negativity of the tokens are related to the streams. To verify this, I will apply a sentiment analysis. This method is used to determine what feelings a writer is expressing in text. This algorithm gives an average polarity score on each list of words (positive or negative). Table 1.

I used a dataset that contains 400K playlists along with different features. In order to approach the problem I defined successful playlists are those that are capable of reaching high number of listeners, focusing on the long-term successes and monthly streams (\u003e30s) as the major metric. After that, I performed a careful exploratory analysis showing the characteristics of the playlists. These are created by either the music platform or independent users. More than 30% of the playlists has less than 10 monthly streams and more than 60% of the playlists contains less than 3 monthly users. Also, the top most streamed playlists has more than 200K monthly active users which is 100.000x the size of those 60% mentioned playlists. This means there is a high proportion of playlists with very low streams and very low engagement and therefore I discarded those as they could be considered as non-successful. Thereafter I compared the relationships between quantitative data with the success metrics. I formulated hypothesis and statistically tested the relationships. I found statistically significant positive weak correlations between the monthly streams and the number of artists, tracks and albums. However, the effect size was small in all comparisons. After that, I discussed the influence of qualitative data on reaching high number of monthly streams. First, I applied sentiment analysis on the tokens feature and I also analyzed the effort proxy i.e., number of tokens and its influence on monthly streams. The tests showed again statistically significant weak positive linear correlations between monthly streams and positive-scored playlists and monthly streams and number of tokens with a small size effect. Next, I focused on lead genre and mood. The most frequent genres are Indi-Rock, Rap and Pop whereas Defiant, Excited and Yearning are the most frequent moods. I also tested if any genre and mood category influence the most on achieving higher number of monthly streams. I found statistically significant differences across genre categories: Latin, Children and Traditional are the lead genres that gets higher monthly streams, again with a small-medium size effect. On the other hand Tender, Lively and Other are the lead mood categories on achieving more monthly streams, this time with a small size effect. Going on the genre and mood study, I analysed the number of genres and moods ( variety proxy ). Here I also found statistical differences on higher number of genre and moods and achieving more streams, having a bigger size effect on the number of moods. To conclude, despite of finding statistical differences on different hypothesis the size effect of the statistical tests was either small or medium. Therefore there is no conclusive insights to clearly state what characteristics successful playlists have.
